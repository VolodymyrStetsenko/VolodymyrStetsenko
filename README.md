## 🚀 My Mission: From Zero to Web3 Security Professional

Welcome to my digital workshop. My name is Volodymyr Stetsenko, and I am on a public journey to become a world-class smart contract auditor. This repository is a transparent, real-time log of my progress, starting from the absolute basics of blockchain technology.

My mission is to meticulously document every step of my learning process—every course, every line of code, every challenge, and every discovery. I am building in public to maintain accountability, share knowledge, and connect with the Web3 community.

## 💡 Why Build in Public?

The Web3 ecosystem's security is paramount. By transparently sharing my learning journey, I aim to:
1.  **Inspire Others:** To show that anyone with dedication can enter the security field.
2.  **Build Trust:** To establish credibility through demonstrated effort and tangible results.
3.  **Foster Collaboration:** To learn from the community and contribute back to it.
